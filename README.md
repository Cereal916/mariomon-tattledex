1. Clone or download this repo.
1. Run `npm install` inside this project folder to install all dependencies.

1. ~Run `ng serve` to see the app in action (try `npm start` in case `ng serve` fails).~
1. ~Connect to app on `localhost:4200`~
1. Due to `angular-pwa` this can can only be viewed on production builds so use `ng build --prod`
1. To serve this you'll need http server : `npm install -g http-server`, this creates a build in `\dist` directory. 
1. Run the server using `http-server -c-1 dist\pokedex`
